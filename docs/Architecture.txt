Project Architecture.

Main project framework is Spring. All classes are Spring components.

Main flow of application:
1. parse csv files:
1.1. read csv file with OpenCsv library;
1.2. parse each row into model class;
1.3. save each model class to corresponding table in database;
2. compare actual and expected:
2.1. read actual list from db;
2.2. read expected list from db;
2.3. compare objects by id first, then by all other object properties;
2.4. push all differences and equals in array list (each row == one list element);
2.5. print result in report file from list;
