Prerequisites:

1. application.properties file should be next to nikolay.jar file or in the classpath.
2. Processed CSV files should be in "files" folder or in a folder that is passed as parameter in application.properties file or passed as parameters to jar file while run.
3. EventByDay file must contain 'by_day' string in its name (by now we map files with its parsers by some substring).
5. EventInfo file must contain 'info' in its name.
4. All files with expected output must contain 'expected'.

Installation instructions:

1. Create schema in MySQL named 'pilot' with default parameters, and set it as default schema;
2. Import SQL script file 'pilot-tables.sql' from zip-archive into MySQL;
3. Unpack nikolay.zip file, open your console and go inside unpacked folder where pom.xml file is located, type command: 'mvn clean install';
4. Go to "target" folder and you will see nikolay.zip file. Unpack it.
5. Type "java -jar nikolai.jar" in the unpacked folder.
6. After that you will see new report txt files with names 'eventInfoReport.txt' and 'eventByDay.txt'.

    docs\
        Architecture.txt
        Install.txt

    files\
        even_info.csv
        even_info_expected.csv
        event_by_day.csv
        event_by_day_expected.csv
    application.properties
    nikolay.jar
